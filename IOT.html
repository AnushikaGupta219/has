            Man took millions of year to reach top of food chain. This achievement took him precisely three revolution to 
            reach top of food chain. <br>
1. Cognitive Revolution<br>
2. Agriculture Revolution<br>
3. Industrial Revolution<br>

        <p>
            Then comes THE INTERNET that took humans to new level of perfect as a species. The era of <b>INTERNET </b>started with 
            rise of <u>“DOT COM”</u> phenomena in 90s. This era gave us Apple, Amazon, paypal etc. Internet compelled human to depend 
            on devices, so IOT came into picture. The paradigm of IOT will have its element in each and every element around us.
             Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and sensor network technologies will rise to connect physical world and virtual 
             world with information and communication systems are embedded in the environment around us. 
This results in the generation of enormous amounts of data which have to be stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient 
and easily interpretable form. Data handling will be a humongous task and Cloud computing have the capacity to assist the virtual infrastructure
 for such utility computing which integrates monitoring devices, storage devices, analytics tools, visualization platforms and client delivery. 
 The cost based model that Cloud computing offers will enable end-to-end service provisioning for businesses and users to access applications on demand from anywhere.
Smart connectivity with existing networks and context aware computation using network resources is an Indispensable part of IoT. With the growing presence of WiFi and 5G 
wireless Internet access, the evolution toward ubiquitous information and communication networks is already evident.

        <h4>Why IoT?</h4>
        <p>
            Devices and objects with built in sensors are connected to an internet of things platform, which integrates data from the different devices and
             applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs. These powerful IoT platforms can 
             pinpoint exactly what information is useful and what can safely be ignored. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, 
             and detect possible problems before they occur. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if I own a car manufacturing business, I might want to know which optional components (leather seats or alloy wheels, for example) are
             the most popular. Using Internet of Things technology, I can:
        <br>
        1.Use sensors to detect which areas in a showroom are the most popular, and where customers linger longest;<br>
2.Drill down into the available sales data to identify which components are selling fastest;<br>
3.Automatically align sales data with supply, so that popular items don’t go out of stock</p>

    <h4>What makes Iot?</h4>
 <br><p>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below:</p>
 <p>
     <b>AI </b>– IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.</p>
 
   <p> <b> Connectivity </b>– New enabling technologies for networking, and specifically IoT networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.</p>
 
   <p> <b> Sensors</b> – IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments which transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world integration.</p>
 
   <p> <b> Active Engagement</b> – Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.</p>
 
    <p><b>Small Devices</b> – Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility</p>
