   <h3>IOT TECHNOLOGY AND PROTOCOLS</h3>
   <p>IoT primarily exploits standard protocols and networking technologies. However, the major enabling technologies and
        protocols of IoT are RFID, NFC, low-energy Bluetooth, low-energy wireless, low-energy radio protocols, LTE-A, and 
        WiFi-Direct. These technologies support the specific networking 
       functionality needed in an IoT system in contrast to a standard uniform network of common systems.</p>

       <h6>NFC and RFID</h6>
       <p>RFID (radio-frequency identification) and NFC (near-field communication) provide simple, lowenergy, and versatile options for identity and access tokens, connection bootstrapping, and payments.<br>
        •	RFID technology employs 2-way radio transmitter-receivers to identify and track tags associated with objects.<br>
        •	NFC consists of communication protocols for electronic devices, typically a mobile device and a standard device<br>
        </p>
        <h6>Low-Energy Bluetooth</h6>
        <p>This technology supports the low-power, long-use need of IoT function 
            while exploiting a standard technology with native support across systems</p>
            <h6>Low-Energy Wireless</h6>
            <p>This technology replaces the most power hungry aspect of an IoT system. Though sensors and other elements can power down
                 over long periods, communication links (i.e., wireless) must remain in listening mode.
                 Low-energy wireless not only reduces consumption, but also extends the life of the device through less use.</p>
<h6>Radio Protocols</h6>
<p>ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Thread are radio protocols for creating low-rate private area networks.
     These technologies are low-power, but offer high throughput unlike many similar options
    . This increases the power of small local device networks without the typical costs.</p>

    <h6>LTE-A</h6>
<p>LTE-A, or LTE Advanced, delivers an important upgrade to LTE technology by increasing not only its coverage, 
    but also reducing its latency and raising its throughput. It gives IoT a tremendous power through expanding its range, 
    with its most significant applications being vehicle, UAV, 
    and similar communication.</p>
    <h6>WiFi-Direct</h6>
    <p>WiFi-Direct eliminates the need for an access point. It allows P2P (peer-to-peer) connections with the speed of WiFi, 
        but with lower latency. WiFi-Direct eliminates an element of a 
        network that often bogs it down, and it does not compromise on speed or throughput.</p>

        <h3>Three c’s of Iot</h3>
        <p>
            •<b>	Communication--</b> IoT communicates information to people and systems, such as state and health of equipment (e.g.it’s on or off, charged, full or empty) and data from sensors that can monitor a person’s vital signs. In most cases, we didn’t have access to this information before or it was collected manually and infrequently. For example, an IOT-enabled HVAC<br>
            •<b>	Control and automation--</b> In a connected world, a business will have visibility into a device’s condition.In many cases, a business or consumer will also be able to remotely control a device. For example, a business can remotely turn on or shut down a specific piece of equipment or adjust the temperature in a climate-controlled environment. Meanwhile, a consumer can use IoT to unlock their car or start the washing machine<br>
            •<b>	Cost saving -</b>Many companies will adopt IoT to save money. Measurement provides actual performance data and equipment health, instead of just estimates. Businesses, particularly industrial companies, lose money when equipment fails. With new sensor information, IoT can help a company save money by minimizing equipment failure and allowing the business to perform planned maintenance.<br>
