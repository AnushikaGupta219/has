            <h4>The below features of Iot are integerated using Iot platform</h4><br>

<h5>IOT platform</h5>
<p>IOt platform is of two types: Wearable and Embedded. Developers can build apps for
     custom wearable devices like Peeble, Samsung Gear or can opt to create their own platform using Embedded solution and then can develop app for that 
     platform</p>

     <h5>Wearable Platform</h5>
     <p><b>Wearable</b> technology is building and managing wearable accessories and sensors to communicate with each other using smart devices. Common examples of 
         wearable techs are fitness trackers, smartwatches, medical sensors, Google glass, etc. ... The apps can be Android, iPhone, iPad, and Google Glass 
         platforms.</p>
      <p> The efficiency of data processing achieved by various smart wristwear, smart clothes, and medical wearables is getting to the point where this 
          consumer-oriented side of IoT technology will bring tangible value for our everyday lives. Soon we will have access to unobtrusive remote healthcare, 
          personal lifestyle management, 
          work assistance, parental control, public safety monitoring, and many other IoT services based on wearable technologies
        
     </p>

     <h5>Embedded Platform</h5>
     <p>Embedded means something that is attached to another thing. An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded 
         in it. An embedded system can be an independent system or it can be a part of a large system. An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor
          based system which is designed to perform a specific task. For example, a fire alarm is an embedded system; it will sense only smoke.</p>

          <p>An embedded system has three components −<br>
            •	It has hardware.<br>
            •	It has application software.<br>
            •	It has Real Time Operating system (RTOS) that supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run a process
             as per scheduling by following a plan to control the latencies. RTOS defines the way the system works. It sets the rules during the execution
              of application program. A small scale embedded system may not have RTOS.
           <p>So we can define an embedded system as a Microcontroller based, software driven, reliable, real-time control system</p>
            </p>

            <h4>Cloud Platform</h4>
            <p>
                IoT cloud platforms bring together capabilities of IoT devices and cloud computing delivered as a end-to-end service. They are also referred by other terms
                 such as Cloud Service IoT Platform. In this age, where billions of devices are connected to the Internet,
                 we see increasing potential of tapping big data acquired from these devices and processing them efficiently through various applications.</p>
<p>IoT devices are devices with multiple sensors connected to the cloud, typically via gateways. There are several IoT Cloud Platforms in the market today provided by different service 
    providers that host wide ranging applications. These can also be extended to services
 that use advanced machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis, especially in disaster prevention and recovering planning using data from the edge devices.
<p>An  Iot cloud platform may be built on top of generic clouds such as those from Microsoft, Amazon, Google or IBM. Network operators such as AT&T, Vodafone and Verizon may offer their own IoT
     platforms with stronger focus on network connectivity. Platforms could be vertically
     integrated for specific industries such as oil and gas, logistics and transportation, etc.
     Device manufacturers such as Samsung (ARTIK Cloud) are also offering their own IoT cloud platforms.</p>
